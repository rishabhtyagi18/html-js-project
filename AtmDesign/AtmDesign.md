<!-- Designing an ATM (Automated Teller Machine) system 

#Requirements

1.Functional Requirements
    User Authentication: Users should be able to authenticate using a card and PIN.
    Balance Inquiry: Users can check their account balance.
    Cash Withdrawal: Users can withdraw cash from their account.
    Deposit: Users can deposit cash or checks.
    Transfer Funds: Users can transfer funds between accounts.
    Print Receipt: Users can print a receipt for transactions.
    Transaction History: Users can view their recent transactions.

2. Non-Functional Requirements

    Scalability: The system should handle a large number of users and transactions.
    Availability: The ATM should be available 24/7.
    Security: User data and transactions should be secure.
    Performance: Transactions should be processed quickly.

High-Level Design
1. Components:

    ATM Interface: User interface for interaction (touchscreen, keypad).
    Card Reader: Reads the user's ATM card.
    Cash Dispenser: Dispenses cash to the user.
    Deposit Slot: Accepts cash or checks for deposits.
    Printer: Prints transaction receipts.
    Network Module: Communicates with the bank's backend systems.

2.Backend Services:

    User Authentication Service: Validates user credentials.
    Account Service: Manages account information, balances, and transactions.
    Transaction Service: Handles transaction processing (withdrawals, deposits, transfers).
    Notification Service: Sends notifications (e.g., transaction alerts).
    Logging Service: Logs transactions for auditing and monitoring.

3.Database:

    User Accounts Database: Stores user account information, balances, and transaction history.
    Transaction Logs Database: Stores logs of all transactions for auditing purposes.


# Sequence Diagram
A sequence diagram can help visualize the interaction between the user and the ATM system. Here’s a simplified flow:

    User inserts card.
    ATM prompts for PIN.
    User enters PIN.
    ATM authenticates user with the User Authentication Service.
    User selects a transaction (e.g., withdrawal).
    ATM requests account balance from Account Service.
    User enters withdrawal amount.
    ATM checks if sufficient funds are available.
    If funds are available, ATM requests cash from Cash Dispenser.
    Cash is dispensed, and a receipt is printed.
    Transaction is logged in the Transaction Service.
    User completes the transaction.

#Data Flow

    User Interaction: The user interacts with the ATM interface.
    Authentication: The ATM sends the card and PIN to the User Authentication Service.
    Transaction Processing: The ATM communicates with the Account Service and Transaction Service to process requests.
    Logging: All transactions are logged for auditing.

#Security Considerations

    Encryption: Use encryption for data transmission (e.g., SSL/TLS) and for storing sensitive information (e.g., hashed PINs).
    Session Management: Implement session timeouts to prevent unauthorized access.
    Fraud Detection: Monitor for unusual transaction patterns and implement alerts.

#Scalability Considerations
    Load Balancing: Use load balancers to distribute requests across multiple ATM machines and backend services.
    Caching: Implement caching for frequently accessed data (e.g., account balances) to reduce database load.
    Microservices Architecture: Consider using microservices for different components (authentication, transactions, etc.) to allow independent scaling.


#Conclusion
Designing an ATM system involves understanding both functional and non-functional requirements, 
creating a high-level architecture, and considering security and scalability. 
This structured approach helps ensure that the system is robust, secure, and user-friendly. 
In an interview setting, be prepared to discuss trade-offs, potential challenges, and how you would address them. -->
